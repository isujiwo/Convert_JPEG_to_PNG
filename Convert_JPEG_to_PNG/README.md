# CONVERT_JPEG_to_PNG

This project contains a simply python script to change file extension from .jpeg to .png

## Requirements
Pillow module

`pip install pillow`

## Two methods:

I accomplished this task in two ways
### Using Terminal
- Add the image in jpeg format with name as 'input' in this folder.
- Run converter_terminal.py script
- output image will be generated in this folder

### Using GUI
Just run the converter_GUI.py script and pick any jpeg image from any location and then press 'Convert Jpeg to Png'
